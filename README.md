Apply Transformer Models to Computer Vision Tasks

The implementation about relative position embedding can refer to:

https://theaisummer.com/positional-embeddings/: BoT position embedding method (refer to BoT_Position_Embedding.png and BoT_Position_Embedding(2).png)

Swin Transformer position embedding refer to Swin_Transformer_Position_Embedding.png

The implementation detail about Swin Transformer can refer to:

One Swin Transformer Block = Swin_Transformer_Stage

Swin_Transformer_Stage = Swin_Transformer + Patch_Merge
